# Data Science
This image is for those who wish to use Python's
machine learning frameworks. We are installing
Tensorflow, Keras, pyTorch, Scikit-Spark, and
openCV. If you would prefer not to use one of the
frameworks, simply remove them from the `Dockerfile`
and rebuild the image.

Additionally, we have a `requirements.txt` file that
can updated with any packages one may need for their
work flow.
